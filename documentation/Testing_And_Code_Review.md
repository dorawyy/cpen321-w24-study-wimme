## 3. Back-end Test Specification: Tests of Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Test Locations in Git

| **Non-Functional Requirement**  | **Location in Git**                                                                            |

| **Reliability and Error Handling**| [`app\app\src\androidTest\java\com\cpen321\study_wimme\Non-Functional Tests\NFR4_Tests.kt`](https://github.com/mayankrastogi02/cpen321-study-wimme/blob/main/app/app/src/androidTest/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/Non-Functional%20Tests/NFR4_Tests.kt)                                               |

### 3.2. Test Verification and Logs

- **Performance (Response Time)**

  - **Verification:** The response time of the API is measured using the `NFR3_Tests.kt` test suite. The test suite sends multiple requests to the API and measures the time taken for the API to respond. The response time is then compared against the expected response time to verify that the API meets the performance requirements. As mentioned in our requirements, the API should respond within 300ms for 95% of the requests. The test reports the response times for each request, the average response time, as well as the maximum response time. If the average response time is less than 300ms and the maximum response time is less than 300ms, the test is considered successful.
  - **Log Output**
    ```
    ...
      Average Response Time: 129.26315789473685 ms
      Max Response Time: 213 ms
      Fastest Response Time: 77 ms
      run finished: 23 tests, 0 failed, 0 ignored
    ...
    ```

- **Reliability and Error Handling**
  - **Verification:** The reliability and error handling of the API are tested using the `NFR4_Tests.kt` test suite. The test suite sends requests to the API with different inputs to test the API's error handling capabilities. The test suite verifies that the API returns the correct error codes and messages when invalid inputs are provided. The test suite also verifies that the API returns the correct error codes and messages when the API encounters internal errors. The test suite reports the error codes and messages returned by the API for each request and compares them against the expected error codes and messages to verify that the API meets the reliability and error handling requirements. If the API returns the correct error codes and messages for all requests, the test is considered successful.

### 5.4. Justifications for Unfixed Issues

- **Code Pattern: [Too many functions inside a/an file/class/object/interface always indicate a violation of the single responsibility principle. Maybe the file/class/object/interface wants to manage too many things at once.](#)**

  1.  **Class 'HomeFragment' with '18' functions detected. Defined threshold inside classes is set to '11'**

      - **Location in Git:** [`app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/HomeFragment.kt`](https://github.com/mayankrastogi02/cpen321-study-wimme/blob/main/app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/HomeFragment.kt)
      - **Justification:** The `HomeFragment`class contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities, such as fetching user data, displaying user data, and handling user interactions. Attempts were made to refactor the code to supress the`method too long` warning, but as a result, the class now contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities. This is a tradeoff between code readability and adherence to the single responsibility principle.

  2.  **Class 'UserSettingsActivity' with '12' functions detected. Defined threshold inside classes is set to '11'**

      - **Location in Git:** [`app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/UserSettingsActivity.kt`](https://github.com/mayankrastogi02/cpen321-study-wimme/blob/main/app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/UserSettingsActivity.kt)
      - **Justification:** The `UserSettingsActivity` class contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities, such as updating user settings, displaying user settings, and handling user interactions. Attempts were made to refactor the code to suppress the `method too long` warning, but as a result, the class now contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities. This is a tradeoff between code readability and adherence to the single responsibility principle.

  3.  **Class 'CreateSessionActivity' with '11' functions detected. Defined threshold inside classes is set to '11'**

      - **Location in Git:** [`app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/CreateSessionActivity.kt`](https://github.com/mayankrastogi02/cpen321-study-wimme/blob/main/app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/CreateSessionActivity.kt)
      - **Justification:** The `CreateSessionActivity` class contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities, such as creating a new study session, displaying study session details, and handling user interactions. Attempts were made to refactor the code to suppress the `method too long` warning, but as a result, the class now contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities. This is a tradeoff between code readability and adherence to the single responsibility principle.

  4.  **Class 'FriendsFragment' with '11' functions detected. Defined threshold inside classes is set to '11'**

      - **Location in Git:** [`app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/FriendsFragment.kt`](https://github.com/mayankrastogi02/cpen321-study-wimme/blob/main/app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/FriendsFragment.kt)
      - **Justification:** The `FriendsFragment` class contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities, such as fetching user data, displaying user data, and handling user interactions. Attempts were made to refactor the code to suppress the `method too long` warning, but as a result, the class now contains multiple functions that handle different responsibilities. This is a tradeoff between code readability and adherence to the single responsibility principle.

- **Others**

  1.  **Expression with labels increase complexity and affect maintainability.** - - **Location in Git:** [`app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/
CreateSessionActivity.kt`](https://github.com/mayankrastogi02/cpen321-study-wimme/blob/main/app/app/src/main/java/com/cpen321/study_wimme/CreateSessionActivity.kt) - **Justification:** The `CreateSessionActivity` class uses labeled expressions to manage complex control flows that are essential for the application's functionality. Removing these labels would significantly increase the complexity of the code and reduce its maintainability. Therefore, the decision was made to keep the labeled expressions to ensure the code remains understandable and maintainable.
